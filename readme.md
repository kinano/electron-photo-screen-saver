# electron-photo-screen-saver

This is a fork from https://github.com/RandScullard/photo-screen-saver
Since Google killed their Picasa screen saver, I needed a way to show images published on theSilentCamera.com using a screensaver.

# Compiling
```
# For Windows
npm install; npm run build; npm start
```

# Installation
* Find the file package\electron-photo-screen-saver-win32-x64\electron-photo-screen-saver.scr.
* Right-click the file and choose Install. When you go to the Windows screen saver settings, you'll see that electron-photo-screen-saver is now your selected screen saver.
